# INST377 Final Project
**Authors:** Anish Babu, Alexia Early, Jason Li

### About Our Project
Our goal with this project was to take data about job openings in Germany accessible for anyone looking to find jobs overseas. We know that looking for jobs is already stressful and for those who are interested in going overseas to Germany face even more stress. This website makes it easy learn about the opportunities there while offering a unique and simple format that allows users to research and save listings for future use.

### Target Browsers
This project is meant to work on any laptop or PC browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, etc.) with no issue. Attempting to load on iPhones, Androids, or tablets will not work due to formatting issues.
